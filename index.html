    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Effective date: May 13, 2025</p>

    <p>
      Sudoku Legend ("we", "our", or "us") respects your privacy. This Privacy
      Policy describes how we collect, use, and protect your information when
      you use our mobile game.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
    <p>
      We do <strong>not</strong> collect any personal data, such as name, email,
      phone number, or location.
    </p>
    <p>
      The game is fully functional offline and does not require registration or
      login.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Analytics & Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
      We may use anonymous analytics services (such as Google Analytics for
      Firebase) to understand user behavior and improve the game. These tools
      collect non-personal data such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Device type and operating system</li>
      <li>Game usage statistics (e.g., levels played, time spent)</li>
      <li>Crash reports</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This data is aggregated and cannot be used to identify you.</p>

    <h2>3. Advertising</h2>
    <p>
      The game may include third-party ads (e.g., Google AdMob). These ad
      providers may use device identifiers to display personalized ads. You can
      opt out of ad personalization in your device settings.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      This game is suitable for general audiences and does not knowingly collect
      personal data from children under 13. If you believe we have collected
      such information, please contact us immediately.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be
      posted on this page with an updated effective date.
    </p>
